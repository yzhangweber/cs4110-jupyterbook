    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook explores key ideas in computational theory through Turing Machine encodings and universal computation. We begin by outlining how Turing Machines can be encoded to standardize the representation of computation. Next, we examine two example languages, ALAN and MATHISON, that highlight how computational problems can be framed within this model."

    "## 1. The Encoding of Turing Machines\n",
    "A Turing machine can be encoded as a string of symbols, allowing us to represent any Turing machine in a standardized format. This encoding is crucial for theoretical computer science as it enables us to treat Turing machines as data that can be processed by other Turing machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Table-Based Encoding Approach\n",
    "The encoding process consists of three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Assign numeric codes to states\n",
    "* Step 2: Convert the Turing machine into a Tabular Representation\n",
    "* Step 3: Encode each transition using 'a' and 'b' Representation\n",
    "* Step 4: Concatenate all individual row encodings into one unified string that encodes the entire Turing Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Assigning numeric codes to states\n",
    "When encoding a Turing Machine (TM) into a formal representation, it is useful to assign numeric identifiers to each state in the machine. This is a foundational step that supports further encoding processes, especially when we aim to represent the TM as a string of symbols or binary digits. To maintain consistency and simplify the encoding, we adopt the following labeling convention:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start State: Always labeled as state 1. This is the initial state where the machine begins execution.\n",
    "* Halt State(s): Always labeled as state 2. This includes any accepting final states. In machines with multiple halting conditions, they can be collapsed into a single halt state for simplicity.\n",
    "* Other States: Labeled incrementally from state 3 onward. These represent the working states of the machine. The ordering of the non-special states does not matter, as long as:\n",
    "    * Each state has a unique label.\n",
    "    * The transitions reference the correct labels.\n",
    "    * The same labels are used consistently throughout the machine’s definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flexibility in ordering makes it easier to write or manipulate TMs programmatically, without worrying about the specific sequence of states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assigning numeric labels serves several important purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Standardization: Provides a consistent way to reference and distinguish states.\n",
    "* Simplifies Encoding: Numeric values can be easily encoded in binary, unary, or any symbolic format.\n",
    "* Supports Automation: Makes it easier to build simulators, compilers, or universal machines that operate on encoded TMs.\n",
    "* Reduces Ambiguity: Prevents confusion that can arise from using arbitrary or descriptive state names like q_start, q_accept.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 Converting the Turing machine into a Tabular Representation\n",
    "Just like finite automata (FAs) and pushdown automata (PDAs), Turing Machines (TMs) do not need to be represented solely using diagrams. Instead, we can describe TMs using a summary table: a compact, structured representation that captures the transition behavior of the machine in a clear and standardized way. After we assign numeric labels to all states, we convert the Turing machine into a standard tabular format. Each row represents one transition rule with five columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* From: The current state (numeric)\n",
    "* To: The next state (numeric)\n",
    "* Read: The symbol being read from the tape\n",
    "* Write: The symbol to write to the tape\n",
    "* Move: The direction to move the tape head (L for Left or R for Right) \n",

    "### 3.1 The Code Word Language (CWL)\n",
    "From the previous encoding section, you may notice that the encoding of a transition follows a specific pattern, which can be represented by a regular expression. The Code Word Language (CWL) is a regular language that describes the valid structure of encoded Turing machine transitions. It provides a regular expression pattern that all valid Turing machine encodings must follow. CWL is defined by the regular expression: \n",
    "\n",
    "CWL = $(a^+ba^+b(a+b)^5)^*$, where $a^+$ stands for one or more $a$'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a valid CWL word, $a^+ba^+b$ encodes the \"From\" state and \"To\" state, while $(a+b)^5$ encodes the \"Read\", \"Write\", and \"Direction\" information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: The CWL defines the pattern for valid Turing machine encodings. This means that any valid Turing machine encoding must follow the CWL pattern. However, not every word in the CWL is necessarily a valid Turing machine encoding, as some CWL words may fit the pattern but fail to represent an actual, meaningful Turing machine. As an example, the string $aababaabbb$ is a valid CWL word because it follows the required pattern. However, when decoded, it describes a transition from state 2 to state 1, which is invalid in a Turing machine because state 2 is a HALT state, and HALT states cannot have outgoing transitions. So, while the encoding fits the CWL pattern, it does not represent a valid Turing machine transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "More examples of CWL words that are valid in form but invalid as Turing machine encodings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ❌ A CWL word that fits the pattern but refers to a transition for a non-existent state\n",
    "* ❌ A CWL word that uses a tape symbol not in the machine’s alphabet\n",
    "* ❌ A CWL word missing key components (e.g., no start state or halt state)\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, CWL sets the “shape” of valid encodings, but additional checks are needed to ensure the content represents a functioning Turing machine.\n",

    "    * Or, $T$ does **not** accept $code(T)$.\n",
    "    * But wait! We assumed $T$ accepts all words in ALAN. So if $code(T) \\in ALAN$, $T$ must accept it. This Contradicts the definition of ALAN, which says that if $code(T) \\in ALAN$, then $T$ does not accept it.\n",
    "* Step 4: Case 2 — Assume $code(T) \\notin ALAN$, then by the definition of ALAN:\n",
    "    * Either $code(T)$ is a valid encoding and $T$ accepts $code(T)$, or\n",
    "    * $code(T)$ is not a valid encoding (which it is, by construction).\n",
    "    * So we get: $code(T)$ is accepted by $T$.\n",

    "This Turing Machine reads a single ‘a’ and moves to the HALT state to accept the string. When we feed its own encoding as input, it accepts it, meaning its encoding is a word in Language MATHISON.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4.3 MATHISON is Recursively Enumerable\n",
    "To prove that MATHISON is recursively enumerable, we observe that each word in the language represents a valid Turing Machine $T$ and that this machine accepts the word (its own encoding). Since the word is an encoding of a Turing Machine, we can reconstruct the machine from the encoding. By simulating this reconstructed machine on its own encoding, we know it eventually halts and accepts its encoding. This means we have a Turing Machine that accepts every word in MATHISON. \n",
    "\n",
    "For words not in the language, the machine may reject or loop forever, which is acceptable for a recognizer. However, we cannot build a Turing Machine that always guarantees rejection for non-members, because determining whether a machine accepts an input is equivalent to solving the Halting Problem, which is undecidable. Therefore, while we can recognize MATHISON by simulating $T$ on $w$ and accepting if it halts and accepts, we cannot decide MATHISON because we cannot always detect non-accepting cases (especially when the machine runs forever).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we have shown that there exists a Turing Machine that recognizes MATHISON. Thus, **MATHISON is recursively enumerable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The question we have yet to answer is: can we simulate the behavior of any Turing Machine on any arbitrary input string, including its own encoding as input? The answer is yes — we can construct a Universal Turing Machine capable of performing this simulation, which we will explore in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4.4 Complement of Recursively Enumerable Languages\n",
    "We are now ready to prove that If $L$ is a recursively enumerable language, its complement $L'$ is not necessarily recursively enumerable. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Since $CWL$ is a regular language, its complement $CWL'$ is also regular.\n",
    "* Because all regular languages are recursively enumerable, $CWL'$ is recursively enumerable.\n",
    "* Consider the union language $L= CWL' \\cup MATHISON$. Since both $CWL'$ and MATHISON are recursively enumerable, their union $L$ is also recursively enumerable (because the class of recursively enumerable languages is closed under union).\n",
    "* Observe that the complement of $L$ is exactly the language ALAN: $L'= ALAN$. But we know that ALAN is not recursively enumerable.\n",
    "* Therefore, we have an example where: $L$ is recursively enumerable, but its complement $L'$ is not recursively enumerable.\n",
