    "A language $L$ is recursively enumerable if there exists a Turing machine $T$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For every string $w \\in L$, $T$ halts and accepts $w$\n",
    "* For every string $s \\notin L$, $T$ either rejects $s$ or loops forever\n",
    "\n",
    "We say a recursively enumerable language $L$ is Turing-recognizable since there exists a Turing machine that accepts every string in $L$. In other words, the machine will eventually halt and accept any input that belongs to the language. Another way to describe this is that there’s a Turing machine that can enumerate all the strings in $L$, one by one. If a string is in $L$, the machine will eventually recognize it and accept it. Later in this section, we’ll introduce Turing-decidable languages, which are quite different from Turing-recognizable ones.\n",

For a string ending in $a$ but without $aa$, the machine will process the string and never encounter two consecutive $a$'s. When it reaches the final $a$, it will transition from state 1 to state 2. Since there are no more characters, it will not move to state 3, but it also has no transition defined for state 2 with blank input. This causes the machine to reject the string (by halting without reaching the accept state). Examples of rejected strings include $ba$, $baba$, $bbba$.\n",

    "**Loop Class**: By analyzing the two loop transitions at state 1, we see that the loop class contains all strings that do not contain the substring $aa$ and end in $b$. For such strings, the machine will process each symbol without ever encountering two consecutive $a$’s. When it reaches the final $b$,  it either remains in state 1 or transitions from state 2 back to state 1. With no further input to process, the machine enters an infinite loop in state 1, causing the machine to loop forever. Examples of strings causing loops include $b$, $ab$, $bab$.\n",

    "Think of a recursive language as a language for which you can write a computer program that always finishes running and always tells you correctly whether the input belongs to the language. We say a recursive language $L$ is Turing-decidable since there exists a Turing machine that decides membership for every string in $L$. That is, the machine will halt on all inputs: it accepts strings that belong to $L$ and rejects those that don’t, with no possibility of looping forever. This makes recursive languages more powerful in a practical sense, because you can always determine whether a given string is in the language. Unlike Turing-recognizable languages, recursive languages guarantee both recognition and rejection through halting behavior. \n",

    "## 4. Key Properties and Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Dovetailing Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1.1 What is Dovetailing\n",
    "Dovetailing is a technique used to simulate multiple Turing machines at the same time, by interleaving their steps. Instead of running one machine to completion before starting the next, dovetailing runs a little bit of each machine in turn, switching back and forth rapidly. When we have multiple machines that might run forever, dovetailing ensures we don’t get stuck waiting on one machine that never halts. Instead, we give each machine a slice of time, so if any one of them halts, we will find out eventually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1.2 How does it work\n",
    "Suppose we want to simulate two machines $T_1$ and $T_2$ on the same input $w$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run step 1 of $T_1$\n",
    "* Run step 1 of $T_2$\n",
    "* Run step 2 of $T_1$\n",
    "* Run step 2 of $T_2$\n",
    "* Run step 3 of $T_1$\n",
    "* Run step 3 of $T_2$\n",
    "* … and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You keep alternating steps between the two machines. As soon as either $T_1$ or $T_2$ halts and accepts, the dovetailing simulation can accept the input immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Union of Recursively Enumerable Languages\n",
    "The class of recursively enumerable languages is closed under union, which means if $L_1$ and $L_2$ are recursively enumerable languages, then their union $L_1 \\cup L_2$ is also recursively enumerable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove correctness, we construct a Turing machine that accepts $L_1 \\cup L_2$ by simulating both machines for $L_1$ and $L_2$ in parallel. The new machine accepts any input string if either original machine accepts it, and it loops indefinitely on strings not in the union, as allowed for recursively enumerable languages. Let $T_1$ be a Turing machine that recognizes $L_1$. Let $T_2$ be a Turing machine that recognizes $L_2$. An important property of recursively enumerable languages is that Turing machines recognizing them are not required to terminate on strings not in the language. For strings $w$, the behavior of our union machine $T_3$ should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $w \\in L_1$ or $w \\in L_2$, then $T_3$ should accept $w$.\n",
    "* If $w \\notin L_1$ and $w \\notin L_2$, then $T_3$ should not accept $w$, it can either:\n",
    "    * Explicitly reject $w$, or\n",
    "    * Loop forever (not terminate at all)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight here is that for an recursively enumerable language recognizer, we only guarantee acceptance for strings in the language. For strings not in the language, there is no requirement to reach a specific decision. Our union machine $T_3$ should preserve this characteristic. This behavior is naturally achieved by the dovetailing construction: \n",
    "\n",
    "* If $w \\in L_1$, then $T_1$ will eventually accept it, and $T_3$ will detect this and accept it.\n",
    "* If $w \\in L_2$, then $T_2$ will eventually accept it, and $T_3$ will detect this and accept it.\n",
    "* If $w \\notin L_1$ and $w \\notin L_2$, then $T_3$ should either reject it or loop forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now here’s an interesting question: can we build a Turing machine that accepts all strings in the union of two recursively enumerable languages, and rejects all strings not in the union without looping forever? If the answer is yes, meaning we can build such a machine or find an algorithm that always halts with the correct answer, then by definition, the union of the two languages would be recursive, not just recursively enumerable. The answer is actually No, we cannot always build a Turing machine that both accepts all strings in the union of two recursively enumerable languages AND rejects all strings not in the union, unless both original languages are already recursive (decidable). We’ll explore the detailed proof after we discuss another key property of recursive languages. Look at it from a different angle: the construction has to deal with situations where $T_1$ runs forever on some input $w \\notin L_1$ and $T_2$ also runs forever on that same $w \\notin L_2$. In these cases, there’s no way for the combined machine $T_3$ to decide in finite time that $w$ isn’t in the union. Since we are building an recursively enumerable recognizer, looping on strings not in the language is normal and actually expected. So let us revise the third step of the dovetailing construction as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $w \\notin L_1$ and $w \\notin L_2$, then $T_3$ will run forever without terminating. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practical implementations of the union construction, we typically do not add explicit rejection logic. Instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dovetailing process continues indefinitely.\n",
    "* If either $T_1$ or $T_2$ accepts, $T_3$ immediately accepts.\n",
    "* If both $T_1$ and $T_2$ eventually reject, $T_3$ could be designed to run forever. Alternatively, we can modify $T_1$ and $T_2$ so that, instead of rejecting words they don’t accept, they run forever on those inputs.\n",
    "* If either $T_1$ or $T_2$ runs forever, $T_3$ does't need any need special handling, because the original machine is already running indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the union machine $T_3$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $ACCEPT(T_3) = ACCEPT(T_1) + ACCEPT(T_2)$\n",
    "* $REJECT(T_3) = \\varnothing$\n",
    "* $LOOP(T_3) = REJECT(T_1) + REJECT(T_2) + LOOP(T_1) + LOOP(T_2)$\n"

    "The complement of a language $L$, denoted as $L'$, is defined as the set of all strings over the alphabet that are not in $L$: $L' = \\{w \\in \\Sigma^* | w \\notin L\\}$.

    "### 4.4 Complement of Recursive Languages\n",
    "If the language $L$ is recursive, then its complement $L'$ is also recursive. In other words, the recursive languages are closed under complementation. To prove this, it is often easier to use Post machines instead of Turing machines. Although Post machines are not covered in detail in this textbook, they are explained in the further reading section. The key idea is to modify a Post machine for a recursive language so that it handles every possible input character by explicitly adding transitions to REJECT states. By adding REJECT states, we ensure the machine has a defined transition for every input symbol in every configuration. This turns the machine’s transition function into a total function. To recognize the complement of the language, we simply flip the ACCEPT and REJECT states. This creates a new Post machine that accepts exactly the strings not in the original language and still terminates on all inputs. Since this new machine also never loops, the complement language is recursive. Finally, because every Post machine has an equivalent Turing machine, this result holds for Turing machines as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach does not work for recursively enumerable languages. We cannot use the same reasoning to show that the complement of a recursively enumerable language is also recursively enumerable, because a Post machine for an recursively enumerable language might loop forever on some inputs. Simply swapping the ACCEPT and REJECT states doesn’t resolve this as any input that originally caused the machine to loop will still loop in the new machine. As a result, the machine cannot decide those inputs, and the complement language may not be recursively enumerable.\n",

    "This combined machine first runs $L_1$ on the input. If $L_1$ accepts it, it then runs $L_2$ on the same input. The machine accepts only if both $L_1$ and $L_2$ accept. Therefore, it recognizes exactly the strings in the intersection of the two languages. Some inputs may still be rejected or cause one of the machines to loop forever. However, since we are only building a recognizer for a recursively enumerable intersection, this behavior is acceptable and does not affect the correctness of the construction.\n"
