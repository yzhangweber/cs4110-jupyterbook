    "## Introduction\n",
    "This section explores the fundamental concepts and properties of Context-free Languages (CFLs), a class of formal languages widely studied in theoretical computer science. We'll cover their definition, closure properties (union, concatenation, Kleene closure), and properties related to intersection and complement.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction to Context-free Languages\n",
    "A context-free language (CFL) is a language that can be generated by a context-free grammar (CFG). The class of CFLs is more expressive than regular languages and can be recognized by pushdown automata. For example, the following languages are all CFLs: Balanced Parentheses Language, Palindromes over {a, b}, $L = \\{ a^nb^n | n ≥ 0 \\}$.\n",

    "## 3. Closure Properties of Context-free Languages\n",
    "CFLs exhibit certain closure properties under specific operations, meaning that if we apply these operations to context-free languages, the result is also a context-free language. We'll explore union, concatenation (product), and Kleene closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Union\n",
    "**Definition**: If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are CFLs, their union is defined as $L_1 \\cup L_2 = \\{ x \\mid x \\in L_1 \\text{ or } x \\in L_2 \\}$. This means any string $x$ that belongs to either $L_1$ or $L_2$ (or both) is in $L_1 \\cup L_2$. Given grammars $G_1 = (V_1, T_1, P_1, S_1)$ for $L_1$ and $G_2 = (V_2, T_2, P_2, S_2)$ for $L_2$, we construct a CFG for $L_1 \\cup L_2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* New start symbol: $S$\n",
    "* Rules: $S \\to S_1 \\mid S_2$, plus all rules from $G_1$ and $G_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem**: If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are context-free languages, then $L_1 \\cup L_2$ is also a context-free language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof**: If we have CFGs $G_1 = (V_1, \\Sigma_1, R_1)$ for $L_1$ and $G_2 = (V_2, \\Sigma_2, R_2)$ for $L_2$, we can construct a new grammar $G_3 = (V_1 \\cup V_2, \\Sigma_1 \\cup \\Sigma_2, R_1 \\cup R_2 \\cup S \\rightarrow S_1 \\mid S_2)$, where $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the start symbols of $G_1$ and $G_2$, respectively, with subscirpts added. This new grammar generates $L_1 \\cup L_2$. Note that in order to create the new grammar, we need to add subscripts to non-terminals in the original grammars to serve the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid Naming Conflicts: if both grammars $G_1$ and $G_2$ have non-terminals with the same name (e.g., S, A, B), this could cause ambiguity when combining them. Using subscripts (e.g., $S_1$, $S_2$, $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$, $B_2$) ensures that symbols from different grammars remain distinct.\n",
    "* Maintain Structural Integrity: by keeping the original non-terminals unique, the derivation rules of each grammar remain unchanged, preventing unintended interactions between the two grammars.\n",
    "* Enable Proper Union Construction: when defining a new start symbol $S$ with production rules $S \\rightarrow S_1 \\mid S_2$, the subscripts make it clear which original grammar each non-terminal belongs to, facilitating a correct and structured combination of the two languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1**: Let $L_1 = \\{ a^n b^n \\mid n \\geq 0 \\}$ (e.g., \"\", \"ab\", \"aabb\") and $L_2 = \\{ a^m b^{2m} \\mid m \\geq 0 \\}$ (e.g., \"\", \"abb\", \"aabbbb\"). Their union $L_1 \\cup L_2$ includes strings like \"\", \"ab\", \"abb\", \"aabb\", \"aabbbb\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CFG $G_1$ for $L_1$ has the productions $S \\rightarrow aSb \\mid \\wedge$. The CFG $G_2$ for $L_2$ has the productions $S \\rightarrow AS \\mid BS \\mid \\wedge; A \\rightarrow aA \\mid a; B \\rightarrow bB \\mid b$. To obtain the CFG for their union:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, add subscripts to non-terminals in $G_1$: $S_1 \\rightarrow aS_1b \\mid \\wedge$\n",
    "* Second, add subscripts to non-terminals in $G_2$: $S_2 \\rightarrow aS_2bb \\mid \\wedge$\n",
    "* Third, add a new production rule: $S \\rightarrow S_1 \\mid S_2$\n",

    "\n",
    "**Example 2**: The CFG $G_1$ for $L_1$ has the productions $S \\rightarrow aS \\mid SS \\mid SA \\mid \\wedge; A \\rightarrow AA \\mid b$. The CFG $G_2$ for $L_2$ has the productions $S \\rightarrow AS \\mid BS \\mid \\wedge; A \\rightarrow aA \\mid a; B \\rightarrow bB \\mid b$. To obtain the CFG for their union:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, add subscripts to non-terminals in $G_1$: $S_1 \\rightarrow aS_1 \\mid S_1S_1 \\mid S_1A_1 \\mid \\wedge; A_1 \\rightarrow A_1A_1 \\mid b$\n",
    "* Second, add subscripts to non-terminals in $G_2$: $S_2 \\rightarrow A_2S_2 \\mid B_2S_2 \\mid \\wedge; A_2 \\rightarrow aA_2 \\mid a; B_2 \\rightarrow bB_2 \\mid b$\n",
    "* Third, add a new production rule: $S \\rightarrow S_1 \\mid S_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the CFG for their union: $G$: $\\{V=\\{S, A, B\\}, \\Sigma=\\{a, b\\}\\, R=\\{S_1 \\rightarrow aS_1 \\mid S_1S_1 \\mid S_1A_1 \\mid \\wedge; A_1 \\rightarrow A_1A_1 \\mid b; S_2 \\rightarrow A_2S_2 \\mid B_2S_2 \\mid \\wedge; A_2 \\rightarrow aA_2 \\mid a; B_2 \\rightarrow bB_2 \\mid b; S \\rightarrow S_1 \\mid S_2\\}\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even $G_1$ does not contain the non-terminal $B$, we still add the subscript 2 to $B$ in $G_2$ to maintain the uniqueness of productions and clearly indicate which original grammar each non-terminal belongs to.\n",

    "**Definition**: The concatenation operation, also known as the product, is a fundamental operation in formal language theory.

    "### 3.4 Kleene Closure (Kleene Star)\n",
    "**Definition**: The Kleene closure (or Kleene star) is a unary operation on a language that produces a new language consisting of all possible concatenations of zero or more strings from the original language. Formally, for a language $L$, the Kleene closure $L^*$ is defined as:\n",

    "where n = 0 implies the empty string ($\\wedge$) is in $L^*$; n = 1 implies $L \\subseteq L^*$; n = 2 implies $LL \\subseteq L^*$, and so on...

This operation allows to express \"zero or more repetitions\" of strings from a language, a concept widely used in pattern matching, lexical analysis, and parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem**: If $L$ is a context-free language, then its Kleene closure $L^*$ is also a context-free language.\n",
    "\n",

    "     - Since $w_1 \\in L$, there's a derivation $S \\overset{*}\\Rightarrow w_1$.\n",
    "     - Inductively, since $v \\in L^*$, there's a derivation $S_1 \\overset{*}\\Rightarrow v$.\n",

    "## 5. The Pumping Lemma for CFLs\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Introduction to the Pumping Lemma\n",
    "The Pumping Lemma for CFLs is a tool used to prove that certain languages are not context-free. It works by showing that any sufficiently long word in a CFL can be \"pumped\", meaning part of it can be repeated while still remaining in the language. If a language does not have this property, then it is not context-free. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Statement of the Pumping Lemma\n",
    "If $L$ is a context-free language, then there exists a constant $p > 0$ (called the pumping length) such that any string $s$ in $L$ with $|s| \\geq p$ can be split into five parts: $$s = uvxyz$$, such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $|vxy| \\leq p$ (the middle section is not too long to ensure the repetition happens \"soon enough\" in a sufficiently long string)\n",
    "* $|vy| \\geq 1$ (at least one of $v$ and $x$ is non-empty since we need something to pump, so at least one of these sections must contain something)\n",
    "* $uv^nxy^nz \\in L \\text{ for all } n \\geq 0$ (the string remains in the language when $v$ and $y$ are repeated or removed simultaneously).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Intuitive Explanation of the Pumping Lemma\n",
    "The pumping lemma is based on the structure of parse trees for context-free grammars. For any sufficiently long string, the parse tree must be sufficiently deep, causing some non-terminal symbol to appear multiple times on a path from the root to a leaf. This repetition creates a \"pumpable\" section in the parse tree, allowing certain parts of the string to be repeated while maintaining grammatical correctness. The key insight is that these repetitions must occur in balanced pairs - we can't pump one part without pumping its corresponding part elsewhere in the string. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure (Figure 1) illustrates a parse tree for a string that has been divided into five parts: $u, v, x, y, z$. This specific structure reveals why we can \"pump\" certain parts of strings in CFLs. Notice how in the tree, there are two occurrences of the non-terminal $A$, one at the top and another in the middle of the tree. When a parse tree gets tall enough (for long strings), some non-terminal symbol must repeat along a path from root to leaf. This creates a \"loop\" in the derivation process. In the diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The section $v$ is generated under the first occurrence of $A$ via the $B$ branch\n",
    "* The section $y$ is generated under the first occurrence of $A$ via the $C$ branch\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this structure, when the non-terminal $A$ appears again in the derivation, we can repeat this entire subtree any number of times. This causes both $v$ and $y$ to repeat in a synchronized way."
