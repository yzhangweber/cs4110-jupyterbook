    "A language begins with a finite set of symbols called an *alphabet*. I trust you're familiar, perhaps from kindergarten, with the idea. Typically we denote an alphabet with the symbol $\\Sigma$. We can form finite sequences of symbols from an alphabet, and a *language* is a specified subset of these sequences. We call the sequences that are in a language the *words* of the language. Please note that we allow the concept of a word with no letters, called the *empty string*, and denote it by $\\lambda$. We also allow the concept of a language with no words, and denote it by $\\emptyset$, the symbol used to represent the empty set.\n",

Well, in this case the method wouldn't work. We can imagine a dictionary that covers every English word, but that won't be possible for every English sentence.

Instead of listing out every one, which would be impossible, we need some way to check whether a sequence of letters matches an acceptable *form*. This form is what we call a *grammar*. If we were dealing with a natural language, we'd also need to make sure that a sentence with proper grammar actually made sense. We probably wouldn't say the example we saw at the beginning of these notes, \"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.\", makes sense, but this concern takes us out of the realm of formal languages.

    "**Exercise 2** - A student suggested the following algorithm to test a string of $a$'s and $b$'s to see if it is a word is $S^{*}$, where $S = \\{aa, ba, aba, abaab\\}$. Step 1, cross off the longest set of characters from the front of the string that is a word in $S$. Step 2, repeat step 1 until it is no longer possible. If what remains is the string $\\lambda$ (the empty string), the original string was a word in $S^{*}$. If what remains is not $\\lambda$ (this means some letters are left, but we cannot find a word in $S$ at the beginning), the original string was not a word in $S^{*}$. Find a string that disproves this algorithm."
