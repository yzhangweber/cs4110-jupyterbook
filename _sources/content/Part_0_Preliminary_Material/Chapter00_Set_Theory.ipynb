For example, you could define sets as being subsets of the real numbers, where the real number line is the universal set. In this context, it makes sense to talk about the *complement* of a set."

    "We've played a bit loose with our definition of a set, and in particular we never made precise what we meant by an \"object\" that can go in a set. Treating set theory like this is called \"naive set theory\", and if you go looking for problems with this naive approach, you can find them. In particular, you can run into contradictions like the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. We won't deal with these issues in this class, but they are serious, and the formal foundations of set theory require a more precise set of fundamental definitions and specifications to fix them.\n",
