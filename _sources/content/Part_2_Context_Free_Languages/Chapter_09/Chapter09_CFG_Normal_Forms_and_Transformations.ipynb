    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Regular Grammar Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular grammar is a special type of context-free grammar where production rules follow specific patterns. In a regular grammar, all productions must be in one of these forms:\n",
    "- $A → xB$ (where A, B are single non-terminals and x is a string of terminals, x can be empty)\n",
    "- $A → x$ (where A is a single non-terminal and x is a string of terminals, x can be empty)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Regular Grammar Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Regular Grammar\n",
    "Given this Grammar:\n",
    "- V: {S, A}\n",
    "- $\\Sigma$: {a, b}\n",
    "- R: $\\{S → aA | bB | a; A → aA | bA | ∧\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a regular grammar because each production follows the specific patterns outlined for a regular grammar.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a regular grammar because each production follows the specific patterns outlined for a regular grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Regular Grammar to Regular Expression:\n",
    "Regular grammars are equivalent in power to regular expressions. Any language that can be described by a regular expression can also be described by a regular grammar, and vice versa. \n",

    "This CFG corresponds to the regular expression **aa*b**, because the **aa\\*** means one or more occurrences of 'a' and is followed by 'b'.\n",

    "Given the regular grammar:\n",
    "- V: {S}\n",
    "- $\\Sigma$: {a, b}\n",
    "- R: $\\{S → abS | baS | ∧\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a regular grammar because each production follows the specific patterns outlined for a regular grammar. We can observe that every string generated by this grammar will consist of any number of occurrences of the substrings \"ab\" and \"ba\" concatenated in some order, and the production S → ∧ allows us to stop the derivation and terminate with the empty string. The language generated by this grammar consists of strings that can be a finite sequence of the substrings \"ab\" and \"ba\" (the strings consist of any number of \"ab\"s and \"ba\"s in any order). Thus, it can be expressed by the regular expression: **(ab + ba)\\***."

    "While these productions can be convenient for describing certain language features, removing them can simplify grammar analysis and parsing.\n",

    "### 2.3 Important Properties\n",
    "* Removing null productions preserves the language defined by the grammar. The only exception is if the original language includes the empty string as a valid word; in that case, the empty string will be omitted from the new grammar, and we can handle this special case separately.\n",

    "    - Iteratively mark any non-terminal A whose right-hand side consists entirely of nullable symbols, such non-terminal has indirect null productions\n",
    "    - Continue until no more non-terminals can be marked nullable\n",
    "2. Generate New Productions:\n",
    "    - For each production A → X₁X₂...Xₙ\n",

    "## 3. Removing Unit Productions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 What Are Unit Productions?\n",
    "Unit productions (also called chain productions) are productions of the form A → B where both A and B are non-terminals. While these productions can make grammars more readable and intuitive, they do not add any meaningful structure to the derivation process and can make parsing less efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Why Remove Unit Productions?\n",
    "1. Parsing Efficiency: unit productions can lead to unnecessary steps in parsing, creating longer derivation chains than needed.\n",
    "2. Grammar Analysis: many algorithms (like CYK parsing) require grammars without unit productions.\n",
    "3. Grammar Simplification: removing unit productions simplifies the grammar while preserving its language.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider this grammar for arithmetic expressions:\n",
    "```\n",
    "E → T\n",
    "T → F\n",
    "F → var\n",
    "F → num\n",
    "F → (E)\n",
    "```\n",
    "While this grammar is readable, it requires three steps (E → T → F → var) to derive a simple variable. After removing unit productions, we get:\n",
    "```\n",
    "E → var\n",
    "E → num\n",
    "E → (E)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This transformed grammar requires a single step (E → var) to derive a simple variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 How to Remove Unit Productions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.1 Unit Pairs and Transitive Closure\n",
    "Before removing unit productions, we need to understand unit pairs and transitive closure. A unit pair (A,B) in a context-free grammar means that A can derive B through one or more (a sequence of) unit productions. The transitive closure of unit productions ensures that if there is a sequence of unit productions leading from one non-terminal to another, we establish a direct connection between them. For example, in the grammar:\n",
    "```\n",
    "S → A\n",
    "A → B\n",
    "B → C\n",
    "C → a\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here are the steps to find all the unit pairs:\n",
    "* Start with direct unit pairs: S → A, A → B, and B → C are direct unit pairs, so we add (S,A), (A,B), (B,C) to the unit pair set.\n",
    "* Extend the pairs transitively: If (S,A) and (A,B) exist, it means S → B exists, then add (S,B) to the unit pair set. We repeat until no new pairs can be added. By extending the pairs transitively this way, We add more pairs (S,C), (A,C).\n",
    "\n",
    "So the unit pairs are (S,A), (S,B), (S,C), (A,B), (A,C), (B,C).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can visualize unit pairs as a directed graph: solid arrows represent direct unit productions, and dashed arrows represent derived unit pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{mermaid}\n",
    "graph TD\n",
    "    accTitle: unit pairs as a directed graph\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.2 Steps to Remove Unit Productions\n",
    "The process of removing unit productions involves three main steps. Let's examine each step in detail with examples.\n",
    "* Step 1. Find all unit pairs\n",
    "* Step 2. Create new productions based on all unit pairs: for each unit pair (A,B), look at all non-unit productions with B on the left side, create new productions by replacing B with A\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4.1 What is Chomsky Normal Form?\n",
    "Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a simplified form of context-free grammars where all productions follow specific patterns. A grammar is in CNF if and only if all productions are of the form:\n",
    "```\n",
    "A → BC (where A, B, and C are non-terminals)\n",
    "A → a (where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 4.2 What Makes CNF Valuable?\n",
    "Chomsky Normal Form is particularly important for several reasons:\n",
    "* It simplifies parsing algorithms (especially the CYK algorithm for membership testing)\n",
    "* It makes certain proofs about context-free grammars easier, such as the Pumping Lemma for Context-free Languages\n",
    "* It provides a standardized way to represent any context-free grammar\n",
    "* It eliminates complex productions while preserving the generated language\n",
    "* It is widely used in compiler design and natural language processing (NLP) for efficient parsing techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Converting a CFG to CNF\n",
    "To convert a given CFG into CNF, follow these steps:\n",
    "* Step 1: Remove all Null Productions (previously covered in earlier sections)\n",

    "    - Step 3b: Convert terminals in mixed productions: replace  terminals in rules like A → aB  with a new non-terminal\n",

    "You may wonder, in step 3b, we introduced a new non-terminal Y with the production Y → a, instead of using the existing production A → a for the conversion. Here is why:\n",
    "* If we had used A instead of Y, we would have replaced S → aB with S → AB. However, in the original grammar, A is already defined with its own role: A → AB | a, using A instead of Y could change the structure of the grammar, possibly affecting the language it generates. In this example, it could have introduced a new production S → ABB, which is not present in the original grammar.\n",
    "* If we directly substituted A for a, it might create ambiguity in how non-terminals are structured. By introducing Y → a, we ensure that every production strictly adheres to CNF without modifying existing non-terminals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing Y ensures that the structure and meaning of the original CFG remain intact while following CNF's strict format. This is a standard transformation technique when converting CFGs to CNF. \n",
