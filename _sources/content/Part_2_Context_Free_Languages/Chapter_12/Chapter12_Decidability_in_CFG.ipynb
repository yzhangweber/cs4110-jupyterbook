    "# Decidability in Context-Free Grammars (CFGs)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This section explores several decidable problems related to Context-Free Grammars (CFGs). Decidability in formal language theory refers to whether an algorithm exists that can determine the answer to a specific problem for all possible inputs within a given class of languages. For context-free grammars (CFGs), several important problems are decidable, meaning there exist algorithms to solve them effectively. This chapter covers key decidable problems in the context of CFGs, including:\n",

    "## 1. Emptiness Problem\n",
    "### 1.1 Definition\n",
    "The emptiness problem asks: \"Is the language generated by a given CFG empty?\" This problem is decidable by checking whether the start symbol S can derive any terminal string. A CFG generates an empty language if and only if its start symbol cannot derive any string of terminals. To determine this, we can use a reachability algorithm that finds all non-terminals that can derive terminal strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A language that consists solely of the empty string $\\wedge$ is not an empty language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Algorithm to Check Emptiness:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initialize a set **derivable** with all non-terminals that have a production directly to terminals or $\\wedge$ (empty string).\n",
    "* Iterate: Add a non-terminal to **derivable** if it has a production where all symbols are either terminals or non-terminals already in **derivable**.\n",
    "* Repeat until no more non-terminals can be added. If the start symbol $S$ is in **derivable**, the language is non-empty; otherwise, it's empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify directly derivable non-terminals:\n",
    "    - Mark any nonterminal $N$ that has a production of the form $N \\rightarrow t$, where $t$ is a terminal or a string of terminals.\n",
    "    - Replace occurrences of $N$ in other productions with $t$, this will remove $N$  altogether.\n",
    "* Repeat the previous step to remove derivable non-terminals until no new non-terminals can be eliminated:\n",
    "    - If $S$ is eliminated, the CFG is not empty.\n",
    "    - If $S$ is not eliminated, the CFG is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Algorithm 1 maintains the original CFG structure and simply tracks which non-terminals can derive terminal strings. Algorithm 2 modifies the original CFG by eliminating non-terminals, which can be useful in further simplifications but changes the grammar structure. Both approaches correctly solve the Emptiness problem, but Algorithm 2's approach of modifying the grammar makes it less suitable for situations where you need to preserve the original grammar structure. However, the substitution method can be more intuitive for understanding why certain strings are derivable from the grammar.\n",

We fill the table from the smallest substrings (length 1) up to the full string.

    "## 4. Finiteness Problem\n",
    "### 4.1 Definition\n",
    "The finiteness problem asks: \"Is the language generated by a CFG finite or infinite?\"  For context-free grammars, determining whether the generated language is finite or infinite is decidable, meaning there exists an algorithm that always terminates with the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Algorithm to Check Finiteness\n",
    "A language is infinite if and only if there exists a derivation path in which a non-terminal derives a string that contains itself, and it can derive a non-empty string (i.e., there's a cycle in the derivation). A CFG generates an infinite language if and only if there exists at least one non-terminal $A$ that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $A$ is useful, meaning it is reachable from the start symbol and can derive a terminal string, and\n",
