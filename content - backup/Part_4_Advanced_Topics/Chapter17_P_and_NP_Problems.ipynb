Well, it would need to create an element in the list for every vertex in the graph, and then it would need to read in every edge and increment the count for two vertices, it would then need to whether each count is even.

    "You might hope a simple algorithm like the one above for Euler circuits exists for determining whether a connected graph contains a Hamilton circuit. Perhaps surprisingly, no such algorithm is known, and its *very* strong suspected (but not proven!) that no such algorithm exists. More precisely, there is no known algorithm that can check whether a connected graph contains a Hamilton circuit in an amount of time that is polynomial in the size (the number of vertices and edges) of the graph. The best general algorithms all must, essentially, just go through all the possible curcuits that don't repeat a vertex (except at the beginning and end) and check each one to see if it's a Hamilton circuit. This isn't very efficient, and the amount of time this takes is exponential in the size of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose instead of determining whether a graph contains a Hamilton circuit, you instead just want to check whether a given sequence of vertices is, indeed, a Hamilton circuit. In other words, you want to *verify* whether a proposed solution is correct. For example, suppose you have the graph $K_{5}$ (the complete graph on 5 vertices) below:\n",

Well, an algorithm for doing so might be to go through the sequence of vertices in the path, and confirm that every vertex in the graph is in the sequence, no vertex in the sequnce repeats (except at the start and end), and every arrow in the sequence corresponds with an edge in the graph. How long would this take? It would be a constant multiple of the length of the path, which would be one more than the number of vertices in the graph. In other words, the amount of time required to check whether a solution is correct would be a polynomial (linear) function of the size of the graph. So, even though we might not be able to always determine if a solution exists in a polynomial amount of time, we are able to *verify* whether a proposed solution is valid in a polynomial amount of time. Problems for which this is the case are in *nondeterministic polynomial time* (NP) complexity. Stated more formally, a problem is in NP if you can determine in a polynomial amount of time whether a solution exists if you are provided with a correct solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we call problems where a solution can be verified in a polynomial amount of time \"nondeterministic\" polynomial time? Well, the basic idea is that suppose we're using the \"brute force\" method of just listing out all the possible solutions and checking them one by one. As we list out possible solutions, we need to make choices. For example, suppose in the graph $K_{5}$ above we're trying to generate possible solutions, and we start on vertex $v_{1}$. Where do we go from there? We could go to $v_{2}$ or $v_{3}$ or $v_{4}$ or $v_{5}$. We need to *determine* the next step, and if we want to explore all the possibilities, we would need to do so *sequentially*. On the other hand, suppose we didn't need to determine the next step, and could explore all the possibilities *simultanously*. In this nondeterministic case we'd be able to list out all the possible paths much more quickly, and checking them all simultanously would only require a polynomial amount of time. In other words, if we could explore the set of possibilites nondeterministically (simultaneously) then we could determine whether a solution exists in a polynomial amount of time. If this is a bit confusing to you, don't worry about it, just remember than NP means a proposed solution can be verified in a polynomial amount of time."
