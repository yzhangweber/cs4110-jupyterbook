    "#### 3.2.5 Rejection Behavior\n",
    "An interesting feature of this PDA is that it has no explicit rejection states. Instead, rejection occurs implicitly when the PDA blocks: meaning the machine reaches a configuration where no valid transition is possible. For example, the input is rejected in the following cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Symbol Mismatch After X: if the symbol being read doesn't match the top of the stack.\n",
    "    - Example: Input \"abXbb\" is rejected because:\n",
    "    - After X, reads first 'b' and pops 'b' (matches)\n",
    "    - Reads second 'b' but top of stack is 'a' (mismatch, PDA blocks)\n",
    "* Improper X Placement: such as missing X marker or multiple X markers\n",
    "    - Example: \"abab\" is rejected (no X)\n",
    "    - Example: \"abXbXa\" is rejected (multiple X)\n",
    "* Stack-Input Mismatch: not enough symbols after X to match stack contents, or too many symbols after X\n",
    "    - Example: \"abXb\" is rejected (stack still contains 'a')\n",
    "    - Example: \"abXbaa\" is rejected (input remains after stack empty)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach to rejection through blocking is common in PDAs and demonstrates how acceptance/rejection can be implemented without explicit reject states. Let's see an example of rejection through blocking. The following example shows how the PDA rejects input through blocking rather than explicit reject states. When reading the second 'b' after X, the top of stack contains 'a', creating a mismatch. Since there's no valid transition defined for this configuration, the PDA blocks and the input is rejected.\n",

    "## 4. Every Regular Language Can Be Accepted by a PDA\n",
    "A regular language is one that can be defined by a regular expression or a finite automaton (FA). A PDA is a more powerful computational model that extends FA by adding a stack. A PDA has two key components beyond those of a FA: a stack and the ability to manipulate it (push, pop). However, a PDA doesn’t need to use the stack to recognize a regular language. By ignoring the stack (i.e., not pushing or popping symbols), a PDA can simulate the behavior of a FA. This ensures that any regular language accepted by a finite automaton can also be accepted by a PDA.\n",

    "## 5. Designing a PDA from a CFG\n",
    "### 5.1 CFGs and PDAs are Equally Powerful\n",
    "In formal language theory, CFGs and PDAs are equally powerful because they can recognize the same set of context-free languages. This means that for any language a CFG can generate, there is a PDA that can recognize it, and vice versa.\n",
    "* If we have a CFG that describes a language (set of valid strings), we can build a PDA that accepts the same set of strings. The PDA follows the rules of the grammar, expanding variables and checking if the string can be derived from the start symbol.\n",
    "* If we have a PDA that recognizes a language, we can create a CFG that generates the same language. The CFG will be constructed based on the transitions of the PDA, ensuring it produces only the valid strings the PDA accepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Systematic Approach\n",
    "When converting a Context-Free Grammar to a PDA, we can follow a systematic approach. The systematic conversion from CFG to PDA is possible due to several fundamental properties:\n",
    "* CFG productions (A → BC) directly map to PDA stack operations. When the PDA sees a variable A, it can systematically replace it with BC. This mirrors how CFG derivations work, making the conversion natural.\n",
    "* Every CFG production becomes a specific set of PDA transitions. Variables on the right side of productions become push operations, and terminal symbols become read/match operations. These mappings are consistent and predictable.\n",
    "* CFG's recursive nature aligns with PDA's stack mechanism. The stack naturally handles nested structures in the grammar and Last-in-first-out (LIFO) property matches derivation order.\n",
